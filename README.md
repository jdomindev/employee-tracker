# Employee Tracker
## Description
- The motivation for this project was to to build a command-line application that manages a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.
- This project has helped me to gain an understanding of how to use MySQL to make a database and tables, and then use Node.js and Inquirer to view those tables and also dynamically add, remove, or view the data that I want.
